    This is my favorite of the exercises. Here I take two number inputs of user choice. I then cycle through the numbers 1-100.  For every multiple of the
    lowest number, the number is replaced by "Fizz". Every multiple of the second number is replaced by "Buzz". Each number that is divisible by both numbers is
    replaced by "FizzBuzz". One intersting caviat that sparked some debate within my household, is what happens when one input is divisible by another. Let's use the
    numbers 3 and 6, for example.  Playing FizzBuzz should result in "1, 2, Fizz, 4, 5...". What happens at 6?  Well, it is divisible by 3, so it should get a "Fizz",
    but it's also divisible by 6, so it should get a "Buzz". It's also divisible by both numbers, which gives it a "FizzBuzz". It turns out, people have differing views
    on what the 'correct' replacement for 6 is.  In this exercise, I have decided to give it all 3!
